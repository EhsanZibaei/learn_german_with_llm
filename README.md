# Flask Web Application

This is a simple Flask web application that you can run locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Project**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Inside the project directory, create a Python virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary Python libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Application**

   Start the web application locally by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Access the Web App**

   Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the application running.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running the app or installing additional libraries.
- You can deactivate the virtual environment anytime by running:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
